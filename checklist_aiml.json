							"remediationInstructions": "<p>There are a variety of defenses that should be implemented to prevent prompt injection. Currently, there is no single measure which prevents all prompt injection. As such, consider using multiple of the following remediation recommendations for a layered defense, ordered from most to least effective mitigation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>System Prompt Refinement:</strong> Restrain LLM to only perform intended business functions by giving it context on what it has access to, actions it can take, and limitations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization:</strong> At the API level, use input length restrictions or character filtering. With regards to the model, include contextual input analysis to train the model to more robustly follow the intended context or AI middleware to analyze if the user input is malicious and should reject it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restricted Response Generation:</strong> Configure the model to avoid generating certain types of responses or engaging in specific topics, regardless of the input prompt.</p></li><li><p><strong>Model Output Filtration:</strong> Use AI middleware to filter out bad responses from the model. Hosted options include Azure Prompt Shield for GPT or Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. If hosted options aren't suitable, a self-hosted option is Llama Guard, which can be used on any model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating Model Robustness:</strong> Regularly assess the LLM's performance against new and varied adversarial inputs to ensure that it remains robust against evolving injection techniques.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security Improvements:</strong> Be aware of existing security improvements relating to libraries and dependency updates, as well as reviewing known vulnerabilities and attacks leveraged against existing models.</p></li></ul><p>If using a self-developed model, incorporate adversarial training into the model's update cycle. Adversarial training involves intentionally feeding the model with a range of sophisticated, deceptive inputs (adversarial examples) during the training phase. This process teaches the model to recognize and appropriately respond to various forms of prompt injections and other malicious inputs. Key aspects of adversarial training include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Creating Adversarial Examples:</strong> Generate inputs that closely mimic genuine prompts but contain subtle manipulations aimed at misleading the LLM. These examples are crafted to test the limits of the LLM's ability to detect and neutralize prompt injections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iterative Retraining:</strong> Regularly retrain the LLM using these adversarial examples, allowing it to learn from its vulnerabilities and improve its detection capabilities.</p></li></ul>"

Unlike direct prompt injection that involves manipulating the model's input directly, this method subtly poisons the information landscape from which the model learns or gathers data. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when models reproduce user-provided information verbatim, which can include malicious payloads. For example, a chatbot that uses user comments to inform its responses could be misled by a specially crafted comment, leading to the generation of harmful or unintended outputs.

							"description": "<p>Data Leakage/Extraction in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to a vulnerability where the model inadvertently discloses sensitive or proprietary information embedded within its training data or through its interactions. This issue is particularly pronounced in Generative AI (GenAI) applications, including Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the LLM might reveal confidential information, system configurations, or specific instructions that are critical for its operation and security. This vulnerability manifests in two primary forms: leaking sensitive information and prompt/context stealing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Leaking Sensitive Information:</strong> LLMs, through their outputs, may reveal parts of their training data that contain confidential or proprietary information. Techniques for extracting such information involve methods like inserting synthetic &quot;canaries&quot; into the training data and developing metrics to measure memorization and exposure. These extraction attacks can reveal personal data, such as email addresses and phone numbers, by exploiting the model's tendency to verbatim memorize and reproduce sensitive details from its training data or the context provided for processing. NetSPI doesn't have access to the training data of a given model, so instead NetSPI strives to show that data can be extracted by taking a more generic approach. Often, if the model openly agrees to return what it might classify as training data, NetSPI calls this finding out. It is difficult to verify, from a black box, whether or not the data that a model is &quot;leaking&quot; are real.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Prompt and Context Stealing: </strong>This aspect concerns the unauthorized extraction of meta prompts or system configurations, which are essential for the LLM's operational security. Well-crafted prompts that align LLMs to specific use cases or instruct them for human alignment are valuable, often considered commercial secrets.  </p></li></ul>",
