Click the &quot;Start Scan&quot; button in the middle of the screen.<br>3. In the pop-up window, add all IPs and domains in scope as a line separated list.<br>4. Data will continue to update as the scan runs. You can view data in ASM by clicking the &quot;View in ASM&quot; button in the upper right.<br>5. Review the data in the Assets and Exposures sections for interesting data and newly discovered assets requiring manual approval such as new root domains or IPs. If new root domains or IPs are discovered, determine if they are in-scope, if so, click the asset, then click the button &quot;Add to Monitoring&quot; to include in future scans.<br>6. Additional IPs and Domains you may discover through manual discovery can be added to the scan scope by clicking &quot;View in ASM&quot;, clicking &quot;Assets&quot; in the left sidebar, clicking either Domains or IP Addresses tile cards, then clicking the &quot;+&quot; button in the upper right corner. Enter the additional assets in right hand pane. Use the &quot;Manual Discovery&quot; option for attribution if needed. <b>Assets added while a scan is currently running will not be added to the scan. An additional scan will need to be run as detailed in the next step.</b><br>7. Once the first scan has completed, a second scan should be run to include any newly discovered data. Click the &quot;View in ASM&quot; button, click &quot;Operations&quot; in the left sidebar, click the ExPen operation, then click &quot;Run&quot; to start another scan.<br>8. Repeat as needed for additional data.<br>9. Once the scan has completed, export the live IP list from the Assets: IPs page for use in Nessus and Nexpose. Export the live domain list from Exposures: DNS for use in scans as well.<br>10. Findings should automatically sync to the workspace once the scan completes, but a manual sync can be triggered if needed by clicking the &quot;Sync to Workspace&quot; button in the upper right.<br><br><b>NOTE: </b>Do NOT click the <b>Scan Certificate Transparency Logs</b> button! The results will automatically be added to ASM monitoring, which will cause ASM to scan out-of-scope hosts during future rounds.<br><br>After ASM completes scanning, make sure to check and see if any IP addresses timed out, and if there are newly discovered domains that should be scanned as well<br><ul><li>Domains that have not been port scanned: Assets &gt; Domain &gt; search bar: !_exists_:live</li><br><li>IPs that timed out port scanning: Assets &gt; IP &gt; search bar:Â portScanTimedOut:true</li><br></ul><br><br><h3>Reporting Requirements</h3><br>Export the following data sources and upload to the Artifacts section in Resolve.<br><ul><li>Assets: IPs</li><br><li>Assets: Domains</li><br><li>Exposures: DNS</li><br><li>Exposures: Ports</li><br><li>Exposures: Certs</li><br></ul><br><h3>Export Instructions</h3><br><b>Assets: IPs</b><br><ol><li>In the search bar, enter 'live:true AND monitored:true' and hit enter to filter by live assets</li><br><li>Check the box next to the ID column</li><br><li>Click the Bulk Options drop down list</li><br><li>Select Export CSV</li><br></ol><br><b>Assets: Domains</b><br><ol><li>Click the 3 bars button to the right of the search bar to change to table view</li><br><li>In the search bar, enter 'live:true AND monitored:true' and hit enter to filter by live assets</li><br><li>Check the box next to the ID column</li><br><li>Click the Bulk Options drop down list</li><br><li>Select Export CSV</li><br></ol><br><b>Exposures: DNS</b><br><ol><li>Check the box next to the ID column</li><br><li>Click the Bulk Options drop down list</li><br><li>Select Export CSV</li><br></ol><br><b>Exposures: Ports</b><br><ol><li>Check the box next to the ID column</li><br><li>Click the Bulk Options drop down list</li><br><li>Select Export CSV</li><br></ol><br><b>Exposures: Certs</b><br><ol><li>Check the box next to the ID column</li><br><li>Click the Bulk Options drop down list</li><br><li>Select Export CSV</li><br></ol><br>","references":[],"isTaskInstructionsVisible":true,"isCommentMandatory":false,"fields":[],"masterFinding":null}}
