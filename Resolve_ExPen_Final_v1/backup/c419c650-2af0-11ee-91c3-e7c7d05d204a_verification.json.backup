It can be used as a general example for the other areas.<br><br><b>Restricted file write</b><br>The vulnerability provides write access to files, but it is restricted to a specific file or path.<br><br><b>Arbitrary file write</b><br>The vulnerability provides write access any file or path. The only thing restricting write access to files in this scenario are the privileges of the acting user. In most cases that will be a service account of some kind.<br>For example, the account running IIS may not have write access the all users startup directory.<br><br><b>Questions to ask yourself</b><br><ol><li>What files and paths can I write to?</li><br><li>Where are OS and application autorun locations?</li><br><li>Do I have administrative write access?</li><br><li>Can I write my own authentication tokens within the application or OS?</li><br><li>If yes, then how do I use them to login?</li><br><li>If not, then write the finding up and move on.</li><br></ol><br>","references":[],"isTaskInstructionsVisible":true,"isCommentMandatory":false,"fields":[],"masterFinding":null}}
