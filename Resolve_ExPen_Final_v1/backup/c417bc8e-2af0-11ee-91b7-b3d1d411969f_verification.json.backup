However, it will output the hostnames that are in-scope. Possible use case is having a giant list of hostnames found during DNS recon, and instead of going one by one and removing that specific hostname, just the in-scope hosts will be returned which you can add to your Nessus/Nexpose/WI scans.<br><br>1.
