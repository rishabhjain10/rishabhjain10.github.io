This includes vulnerabilities that have been successfully exploited in the past or that provide a man-in-the-middle position.<br><br>Vulnerabilities that were successfully exploited during testing will be labeled as Entry Points, so they can be prioritized during remediation.  <br><br>Example: Code execution, arbitrary file read/write, persistent code injection, PHI/PCI data exposure. <br></code><br><h3><b>High</b></h3><br><code><b>CVSS Range: </b>  7.0 - 10.0 <br><br><b>Definition</b><br>Vulnerabilities with the potential to provide direct, unauthorized, remote access to protected networks, systems, application functionality, or sensitive data. However, these may not have exploitable code available, or require rare configurations to be exploitable.<br><br>Example: Code execution, arbitrary file read/write, persistent code injection, PHI/PCI data exposure. <br></code><br><h3><b>Medium</b></h3><br><code><b>CVSS Range: </b> 4.0 - 6.9 <br><br><b>Definition</b><br>Vulnerabilities that result in the exposure of session data or security configuration information. Unencrypted transmission of sensitive data, or use of weak encryption methods. This includes management, database, and file sharing interfaces that are exposed to the internet, but do not currently enforce multi-factor authentication.<br><br>Example: Cross-site scripting, open SMTP relay, clear text storage of passwords/sensitive data, and cleartext management protocols such as telnet. <br></code><br><h3><b>Low</b></h3><br><code><b>CVSS Range: </b> 0.0 - 3.9 <br><br><b>Definition</b><br>Vulnerabilities that result in the exposure version information or non-critical configuration information. Best practice configurations that help reduce attack surface and reduce the chance of the successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities.<br><br>Example: Most SSL findings, RDP findings, password policy best practices, and large number of members in privileged groups.<br></code><br>","references":[],"isTaskInstructionsVisible":true,"isCommentMandatory":false,"fields":[],"masterFinding":null}}
