							"remediationInstructions": "<p>Employ a layered approach to security that includes using parameterized queries when accepting user input. Strictly define the data type (for instance, a string, an alphanumeric character, etc.) that the application will accept and harden the database server to prevent data from being accessed inappropriately. Also, ensure that all data used by the application is put through a data input filter that removes potentially harmful characters. Best practice recommends the use of allowlists using regular expressions.</p><p>Disable detailed error messages that could give an attacker information about database names, table names, versions and type of databases being used. Replace the error message with a generic error asking the user to contact the IT department or send an e-mail to the web administrator.</p><p>A non-privileged service account should be used to run the database server, and the database user in use should not have administrative privileges to the database. Following the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions for the service account and database user helps limit the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.</p>"

If this is not an option, an attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server.</p>",
							"sourceIdentifier": "BUR:1052800",
							"verificationInstructions": "<p>The following process should be used when identifying and exploiting server-side template injection: Detect &gt; Identify &gt; Exploit.</p><p><strong>Detect:</strong></p><p>The first step is discovering the injection. Try fuzzing the template by submitting characters such as <code>${{&lt;%[%'&quot;}}%\\</code> and looking for error messages in the HTTP response. Attempt to insert payloads such as <code>${7&#42;7}</code> and <code>{{7&#42;7}}</code> and look to see if the payloads are treated as data (i.e. <code>{{7&#42;7}}</code>) or templating code (i.e <code>7777777</code>). Another way to induce application errors is with the payload <code>${7/0}</code> or something similar that would induce a divide-by-zero error. The responses will help you determine if the parameter is injectable.</p><p><strong>Identify:</strong></p><p>After you have confirmed the vulnerability, the next step is to identify the templating language involved. This information might be included in error messages achieved during the detection phase, but if not there are other ways to determine the templating language. While most templating languages are syntactically similar, they do not always process code in the same manner. For instance, the payload <code>{{7&#42;'7'}}</code> returns <code>49</code> in the Twig framework and <code>7777777</code> in the Jinja framework. It is important to read the documentation for each framework to understand how each templating language will interpret various code snippets.</p><p><strong>Exploit:</strong></p><p>At this stage you have verified the template injection is valid and you know the framework involved. Now the only part left is to use a suitable payload to show the impact of the vulnerability. This can be achieved by reading the documentation for potential security risks, looking for known exploits, and exploring your level of access by submitting various payloads. For instance, the following payload will return the user under which the server is running: <code>&lt;% import os x=os.popen('whoami').read() %&gt; ${x}</code>. It is important to read the documentation very carefully for the templating engine you are attempting to exploit. The application may implement sandbox security controls that may limit your access, so you may have to get creative with finding a way to bypass these mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Reporting Requirements:</strong></p><p>The following method should be used when it comes to reporting:</p><p>1. Screenshot the initial page.</p><p>2. Show the HTTP request in which you detect the server-side template injection vulnerability and highlight the error message or result.</p><p>3. If necessary, show the HTTP request in which you identify the templating engine and highlight the result. Be sure to explain how the payload relates to the templating engine.</p><p>4. Show the HTTP request in which you exploit the templating engine by submitting a payload and achieving some form of remote code execution. A simple example could be retrieving the username running the server (<pre><code>whoami</code></pre>) or the user/group information (<pre><code>id</code></pre>). You could also try retrieving information from <code>/etc/passwd</code> or <code>.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>- https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection</p><p>- https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection</p>",

							"description": "<p>DOM-based cross-site scripting was discovered within the application. In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page, as opposed to other XSS types (Reflected and Stored XSS) where the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script (such as JavaScript) that is sent to the client and performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data, and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.</p><p>The following code snippet (age.html) demonstrates a DOM Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability:</p><pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;\n    \t&lt;BODY&gt;\n    \t\tHello!\n    \t\t&lt;BR&gt;\n    \t\tYour age is: \n    \t\t&lt;SCRIPT&gt;\n    \t\t\tvar position=document.URL.indexOf(\"age=\")+4;\n    \t\t\tdocument.write(document.URL.substring(position,document.URL.length));\n    \t\t&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;\n    \t&lt;/BODY&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;</code></pre><p>Normally, this HTML page would be used for presenting the user's age, e.g.: </p><pre><code>http://SERVER/age.html?age=21</code></pre><p>However, issuing the following request will result in an XSS condition:</p><pre><code>http://SERVER/age.html?age=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre><p>Note there is no need for malicious code to be embedded in the server's response for the attack to succeed.</p>",

Additionally, any further requests over unencrypted HTTP by the browser will automatically be converted to encrypted HTTPS.</p><p>Consider following attack scenarios:</p><ul><li><p>Users often omit the URI scheme i.e., https:// when typing a URL in location bar to access a website. Also, third party websites can link to the site using the http scheme instead of https. This could result in an initial connection to an HTTPS-enabled site over an unencrypted channel. An eavesdropping attacker can hijack this unencrypted connection and replace the intended use of HTTPS protocol with HTTP in an attack known as SSLStrip, granting unauthorized access to all subsequent traffic.</p></li><li><p>Websites often transfer non-sensitive resources such as help documents over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

It is possible to forge the Referer header, so validating the Referrer header should not be used as the sole measure to prevent CSRF. However, checking the Referer header does add a layer of security to the application. It should be noted that some firewalls or browser settings remove the Referer header, which could lead to a denial of service for legitimate users.</p></li><li><p>Use tokenizing. Tokenizing is a concept of adding a random, per-request token in the HTTP response that is sent from the server to the client. The client parses the response and extracts the token from it. With the next request, the client sends the token back to the server. The server accepts the request only if the token is the same as the token in the last response.</p></li></ul>"
