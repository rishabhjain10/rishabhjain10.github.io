This could lead to the discovery of other vulnerabilities within available web services.","description":"A web services description document has been discovered on the server. Definition files contain information about the web services methods that the server offers. An unintended exposure of this information can cause unauthorized access to server methods. It may be possible for an attacker to bypass the client application and make unauthorized requests to web services methods.\n"}}}
