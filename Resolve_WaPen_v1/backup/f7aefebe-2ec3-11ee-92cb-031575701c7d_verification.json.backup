Cookies are often used as session identifiers, as well as to store personalization and customization information. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist in the browser's memory and are not stored anywhere. Persistent cookies, however, are stored on the hard drive. This can cause security and privacy issues depending on the information stored in the cookie and how it is accessed. From a coding perspective, the distinction between a session cookie and a persistent cookie is the 'Expires=' tag that specifies when a persistent cookie should expire. If a cookie has no 'Expires=' tag, then it is automatically interpreted as a session cookie.\n"}}}
