Expression Language allows JSP pages to easily access application data stored in user-defined JavaBeans components as well as the implicit objects. In addition, JSP pages can also invoke arbitrary public and static methods and perform arithmetic operations using EL expressions. EL injection vulnerabilities are introduced when an application fails to validate untrusted user data before assigning it to attribute values of certain Spring MVC JSP tags. \n\nBy allowing attackers to inject EL expressions through insufficiently validated user input, an application could grant unauthorized access to sensitive application and server information. EL injection could also let attackers bypass HTTPOnly access restrictions imposed on cookies by exploiting access to the implicit cookie object made available in EL expressions.\n"}}}
