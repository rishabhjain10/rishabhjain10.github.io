Additionally, the stolen credentials could be used in further attacks against the target system.","description":"Social security numbers (SSN) are disclosed by the application in cleartext. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application could also gain access to SSNs. Additionally, displaying sensitive information such as SSNs in cleartext increases the likelihood of a malicious individual to view this information either in person or through screen capturing software.\\n"}}}
