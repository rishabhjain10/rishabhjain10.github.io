While it's difficult to tell what's going to be a false positive ahead of time, double checking is usually pretty easy: most tools will include the request submitted as well as the response, highlighting what about them indicates the vulnerability.\nKnowledge of how the vulnerability works and why it trigged in the application will be needed to firmly determine if it's a false positive or not.

For instance, mobile users may get a reduced window size with larger buttons that is more convenient for a touch screen. Different browsers support different features and render pages slightly differently, which can result in different pages being presented to the user. There is also the odd chance that the application will expose functionality to a client with a particular user agent.\n\nAdditionally, many web applications will allow crawling and indexing bots, such as Google or Bing, in to certain parts of the application which may otherwise require authentication; this can allow for bypasses and potentially expose sensitive information.\n\n\n-- Tools --\n\nChrome / Firefox extension: User-Agent Switcher\nBurp Suite: Proxy - Options - Match and Replace\nhttps://tools.kali.org/web-applications/ua-tester\nhttps://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/eyewitness\nhttps://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/options#match-and-replace",
