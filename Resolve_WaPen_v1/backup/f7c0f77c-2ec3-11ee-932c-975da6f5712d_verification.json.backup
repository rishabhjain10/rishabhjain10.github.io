Always encrypt credit card data stored in databases.  Also, ensure that the key used for encryption is not stored on the same server, or in the same database.\n","name":"Unencrypted Storage of Card Holder Data - Database","sourceId":"M:488471","severity":"Medium","businessImpact":"Storing credit card numbers in clear text could result in the exposure of personal identifiable information.  If an incident occurred the company would be legally obligated to report the breach to customers.  As a result, there may be a monetary loss due to damaged reputation, penalties, and fines.","description":"At least one database on each of the affected systems stores cleartext credit card numbers.  Cleartext credit card numbers are accessible because no encryption or hashing methods are being used.  Also, cleartext credit card numbers are typically found in environments where data classification and protection policies do not exist or are not being enforced. \n\nPlease note that this issue was only tested on a small sample of the target systems and may exist on systems not listed in this finding.\n"}}}
