If the files contain sensitive information, report it separately; the finding depends on type of data identified.

If the application requires that the web server be configured to allow directory listings, then alternative access controls should be considered.  For example, access to web directories could be blocked via firewall rules, web application firewall modules, and serve- side controls such as URLScan.\n","name":"Information Disclosure - Directory Listing","sourceId":"GID:2387","severity":"Medium","businessImpact":"Risks associated with an attacker discovering a directory listing on the application server depend upon what type of directory is discovered and what types of files are contained within it. Files such as data files, source code, or applications under development will then be visible to a potential attacker.","description":"A directory listing is a complete index of all the resources located in that directory. Files that should remain hidden, such as data files, backed-up source code, or applications in development may be visible. The specific risks depend upon the specific files that are listed and accessible.\n"}}}
