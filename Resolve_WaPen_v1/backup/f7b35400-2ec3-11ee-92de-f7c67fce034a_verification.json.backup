The SSL/TLS protocol permits the server to support some or all these cipher suites and during the initial SSL/TLS session setup stage, it allows the client to pick the cipher suite to be used for that session. The hosts use certificates and public and private session keys to securely negotiate the cipher suite to be used.\n\nEncryption ciphers that use keys shorter than 128 bits are considered cryptographically insecure. It may be possible to decrypt messages that have been encrypted with a weak cipher. Additionally, some encryption ciphers are considered insecure due to known weaknesses in their implementation, such as 3DES due to Sweet32, RC4 due to Bar Mitzvah, and CBC ciphers due to padding oracle attacks.\n\nWeak SSL/TLS ciphers are not necessarily used by default when they are enabled. However, an attacker may be able to force an SSL/TLS connection to use weak ciphers. It should be noted that disabling weak ciphers prevents legacy browsers from successfully establishing an SSL/TLS connection.\n"}}}
