An account should become locked after six invalid login attempts. Accounts should be locked for a set time or until an administrator unlocks the account. This will help mitigate the risk associated with an attacker trying to guess valid credentials via a brute force attack.\n\nFor application, depending on the sensitivity, OWASP recommends the lockout period to be 15-30 minutes.\n\nFor Windows Domain, Microsoft recommends the following lockout policy:\n<ul><li>Lockout threshold: 5</li>\n<li>Lockout duration (minutes): 15</li>\n<li>Lockout observation window (minutes): 15</li>\n</ul>\n","name":"Account Policy - Weak Lockout Policy","sourceId":"M:89ead67c-6bba-e211-b9cf-001e4f12001e","severity":"Medium","businessImpact":"If an account lockout policy is not enforced, then there is a greater chance that an attacker could gain unauthorized access to application functionality by conducting dictionary attacks against known application user accounts.","description":"The application does not appear to enforce an account lockout policy or has a weak lockout policy.\n"}}}
