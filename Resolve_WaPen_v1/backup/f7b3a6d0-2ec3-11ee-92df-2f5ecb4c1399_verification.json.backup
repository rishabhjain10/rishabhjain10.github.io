If the methods are required for the operation of the server, ensure that only authenticated users can submit PUT or DELETE requests.\n\nRegardless of the operating system and web server type, it is a best practice to run web services as non-privileged user. File permissions in the web directories should be configured according to the principle of least privilege; web service should not have more than read access to files and execute access to scripts and directories.\n","name":"Weak Configuration - PUT Method Allowed","sourceId":"WI:3427","severity":"High","businessImpact":"If an attacker can upload web application files, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Arbitrary command execution gives an attacker complete access to the server with the permissions of the account running the web server. This may lead to the complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected server.","description":"The PUT method can be used to place files in directories, provided that the PUT method is enabled on the directory and that the web server has write access to the directory. The PUT method can be exploited to upload malicious files and scripts to the server. It may be possible to use these files and scripts to execute commands on the target host within the permissions context of the web server process. Deletion and modification of existing files on the server is also typically possible when the PUT method is enabled.\n"}}}
