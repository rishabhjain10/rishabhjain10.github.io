Additionally, an attacker with rights to edit permissions may be able to restrict access to existing data in the S3 bucket.\n\nIf the Authenticated Users group is utilized in the bucket ACLs, any user with an AWS account may have rights on the bucket, while an anonymous user might not have access. The Authenticated Users accounts are not restricted by the bucket's IAM accounts and could allow other AWS accounts to gain access to the buckets.\n","description":"AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) allows users to register custom domains for their S3 buckets.  Misconfigured buckets will sometimes allow directory browsing, revealing the full file structure when the subdomain is directly browsed to.\n\nThe affected buckets allow for either anonymous or AWS authenticated (non-client accounts) users to access the data.\n"}}}
