{"default_url":null,"content":{"state":0,"taskInstructions":"During the kickoff call, take as many notes as possible; review the recording if you need to in order to make sure nothing was missed.\nIf the notes were not taken in Resolve directly, copy them over from whatever note taking tool (such as OneNote) you used.\nThis cannot be stressed enough: <b>do not rely on memory alone for all of these details.</b>\n\nThe below can be used as a guide to which pieces of information to document, and which questions to ask during the demo: \n<ul><li>Document the application name and version.</li>\n<li>What is the application used for, at a high level?  (e.g. online banking, document repository, medical record tracking etc.)</li>\n<li>What is the application architecture, at a high level? (ask about web server, database, Web Application Firewall(s), load balancers) </li>\n<li>What technologies used for the web server? (e.g. Java, ASP.NET, Tomcat, IIS etc.)</li>\n<li>How is user authentication handled? (e.g. SSO, forms based, integrated)</li>\n<li>Which user roles exist in the application and what's the function of each? </li>\n<li>Is there any tenancy to the application? (e.g. tenant1 should not be able to see information for tenant2) </li>\n<li>What kind of database integration? Database type? Authentication? (e.g. MSSQL with integrated auth, Oracle)</li>\n<li>Does the application store any sensitive or regulated information? (e.g. SSNs, credit card numbers, industry secrets, PHI)</li>\n<li>What information or functionality is limited to certain users? (e.g. user administration, PHI)</li>\n<li>Is there any specific information needed to use the application? (e.g. valid client IDs, SSNs, valid credit cards)</li>\n<li>What are the key functions in the application?</li>\n<li>Are there any critical areas that should be focused on?</li>\n<li>Are there any areas that are unstable or should be excluded? Pay particular attention to 3rd party components.</li>\n<li>Is there specific application flow that has to be followed to properly use the application?</li>\n<li>Are there any known vulnerabilities?</li>\n</ul>\n","references":[],"isTaskInstructionsVisible":true,"isCommentMandatory":false,"fields":[],"masterFinding":null}}
