If the cookie contains sensitive data (such as a session token) then this data may be accessible by less trusted or less secure applications residing at those domains, leading to a security compromise.","description":"A cookie's domain attribute determines which domains can access the cookie. Browsers will automatically submit the cookie in requests to in-scope domains, and those domains may be able to access the cookie via JavaScript. When a cookie is scoped to the parent domain, browsers will send it to any sites in the domain that the user visits. If sites use the same cookie for session management, exposure of the cookie on one site can lead to an attacker gaining access to the other sites as well. If sites exist in the domain that do not make use of the cookie, vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting in those sites may still be exploited to access the cookie and serve as entry points to further exploit the sites which do rely on the cookie for sensitive functionality.\n"}}}
