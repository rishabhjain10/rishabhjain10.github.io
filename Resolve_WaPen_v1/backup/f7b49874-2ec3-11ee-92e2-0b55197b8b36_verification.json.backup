Add columns for MasterFindingId, IP Address, and Port if they're not already there. Don't worry about removing columns or adding additional ones. Autofier will figure it out. Export the CSV file of the findings. Change the &quot;Master Finding ID&quot; column header to &quot;MasterFindingId&quot; so the tool can parse it correctly. \n\nRun the tool against the list of findings.\n\nOnce the tool has ran and you have the output CSV, follow these steps:\n1. Change all findings to False Positive. \n2. Add a manual instance of the finding.\n3. Choose Multiple Assets, Bulk Upload Assets, and Upload IP Addresses\n4. Open the CSV in Excel. Select the IP address and port of the assets which Failed. (Double check the &quot;name&quot; field and make sure you're only selecting the correct findings.) Format them as IP:Port (  =CONCAT(D2,&quot;:&quot;,E2)    ) and paste them into the &quot;Upload IP Addresses&quot; field.\n5. Check the &quot;Update existing duplicate instances&quot; box, and under Instance Information, set the State to &quot;Final&quot;\n6. Click &quot;Add Instance&quot;\n7. Do a couple of spot checks to make sure the statuses in Resolve match what's in the tool output.\n\n","remediationInstructions":"Disable the use of SSLv2.0 and SSLv3.0 as well as TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1.
