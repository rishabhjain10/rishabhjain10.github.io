All authentication checks should verify that all necessary authentication information (such as passwords or MFA tokens) has been properly provided.  Any part of the application that relies on user input to return data should perform server-side authentication checks. Do not rely on authentication checks that are performed client-side, as the client may be able to manipulate and bypass these checks.  Ensuring that server-side authentication checks are in place will help prevent users from gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality within the application.\n","name":"Authentication Bypass - Parameter Manipulation","sourceId":"M:4ba716e4-7fde-e211-86a8-001e4f120032","severity":"High","businessImpact":"An unauthenticated user could gain access to an authenticated session and all associated permissions without providing the necessary authentication information.\n","description":"The application's authentication mechanism is vulnerable to manipulation. By providing a specially crafted request, an attacker can bypass the intended authentication process and gain access to an authenticated identity without sufficiently proving their control of that identity (for example, by providing a password).\n"}}}
