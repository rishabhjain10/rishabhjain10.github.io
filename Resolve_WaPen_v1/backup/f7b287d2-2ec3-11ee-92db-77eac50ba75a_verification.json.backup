If an attacker were to gain access to this page for another user's account (for instance, through cross-site request forgery), the attacker would be able to change the password to a known value and log in as that user. The attacker would be able to access the user's information and take actions as that user within the application. This can also be used to cause a denial-of-service to the affected user until the user can have their password reset.\n","description":"It is possible to change a user's password without providing the user's old password. Were a malicious user to gain access to the session of another legitimate user, the malicious user could change the affected user's password without providing the targeted user's old password. To exploit this issue, the attacker would need access to the victim's session. This could be accomplished by session hijacking or a user leaving themselves logged in at a public or shared workstation.\n"}}}
