Password policies should include the following primary components:\n<ul><li>Password minimum length of twelve or more characters</li>\n<li>Password complexity requirements that require each password contain three of the following: a lower-case letter, an upper-case letter, a number, a special character</li>\n<li>Password cannot be the same as the username</li>\n<li>Password cannot be a dictionary word</li>\n</ul>\n","name":"Weak or Default Password - Web Administration","sourceId":"M:162364","severity":"High","businessImpact":"Allowing weak and default passwords on accounts used to access administrative consoles may lead to the full compromise of the affected application and system. An attacker may use affected accounts to extract, modify, add, or delete configurations and information on the device.\r\n\r\nAlso, depending on the nature of the administrative console, an attacker may be able to cause denial of service attacks against remote systems and applications.\r\n","description":"The affected web-based administration consoles either do not require authentication or are configured with accounts that use default or weak passwords.\n\nDefault passwords are initially set by the software or device vendor when a product is sold. Weak passwords are passwords that can be easily guessed. Default and weak passwords are commonly found in environments where a password policy does not exist or is not being enforced.\n"}}}
