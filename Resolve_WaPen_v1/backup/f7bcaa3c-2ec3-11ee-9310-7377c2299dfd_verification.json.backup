Also consider using search engine crawler User Agents, these sometimes allow access to authenticated pages.\n\nWith a little setup, you can run EyeWitness against a list of URLs and provide the <ncode>--cycle</ncode> flag with the appropriate type of user agents to try, such as \"Browser\", \"Mobile\", \"Crawler\", or even \"All\".

For instance, mobile users may get a reduced window size with larger buttons that is more convenient for a touch screen. Different browsers support different features and render pages slightly differently, which can result in different pages being presented to the user. There is also the odd chance that the application will expose functionality to a client with a particular user agent.\n\nAdditionally, many web applications will allow crawling and indexing bots, such as Google or Bing, in to certain parts of the application which may otherwise require authentication; this can allow for bypasses and potentially expose sensitive information.\n\n\n-- Tools --\n\nChrome / Firefox extension: User-Agent Switcher\nBurp Suite: Proxy - Options - Match and Replace\nhttps://tools.kali.org/web-applications/ua-tester\nhttps://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/eyewitness\nhttps://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/options#match-and-replace","references":[],"isTaskInstructionsVisible":true,"isCommentMandatory":false,"fields":[],"masterFinding":null}}
