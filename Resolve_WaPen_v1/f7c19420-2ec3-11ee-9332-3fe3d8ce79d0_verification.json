Identify Windows services configured to run using a Windows or Active Directory accounts configured with excessive privileges.  For example, local administrator and domain administrative privileges.  A quick method for identifying Domain Admins is to dump a list of user SPNs from the domain.  Local account examples include SQL Server service accounts configured with local administrator rights.<br>2. Add this finding.<br>3.

Ensure that service account privileges are granted according to the principle of least privilege. Windows services should be configured to use the 'local service' or 'Network Service' account or a 'domain' account with only the privileges necessary for the service account to run.   <br><br><b>Domain User Account</b><br>If the service must interact with network services, access domain resources like file shares or if it uses linked server connections to other computers, use a minimally privileged domain account. Many server-to-server activities can be performed only with a domain user account. This account should be pre-created by domain administration in the environment.<br><br><b>Local Service Account</b><br>The Local Service account is a built-in account that has the same level of access to resources and objects as members of the Users group. This limited access helps safeguard the system if individual services or processes are compromised. Services that run as the Local Service account access network resources as a null session without credentials. The actual name of the account is \"<code>NT AUTHORITY\\LocalService</code>\".<br><br><b>Network Service Account</b><br>The Network Service is a built-in account that has minimal privileges on the local computer.

Because of excessive privileges, the attacker may be able to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected server and its associated applications.","description":"One or more service accounts are configured with excessive privileges.<br>"}}}
