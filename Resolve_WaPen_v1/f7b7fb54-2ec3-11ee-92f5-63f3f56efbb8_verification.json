If the domain in the URL does not match the domains set in this parameter, the redirect is denied. By default, this is disabled.<br><br>The <code>ValidTargetDomain </code>parameter identifies the valid domains for the target during processing. Before the user is redirected, the agent compares the values in the redirect URL against the domains in this parameter. Without this parameter, the agent redirects the user to targets in any domain. The <code>ValidTargetDomain </code>parameter can include multiple values, one for each valid domain.<br><br>For local agent configurations, specify an entry, one entry per line, for each domain, for example:<br><code>validtargetdomain=\".xyzcompany.com\"<br>validtargetdomain=\".abccompany.com\"<br></code><br>","name":"Parameter Based Redirection","sourceId":"WI:10705","severity":"Medium","businessImpact":"Were a user to click on a maliciously crafted link sent by an attacker, the user would be redirected to a web site of the attacker's choosing. This could aid in phishing attacks or automated exploits of outdated or unpatched browsers. Were a user to fall victim to a phishing attack, their credentials could be stolen. If a user with an outdated or unpatched browser clicked on the URL, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.","description":"It is possible to cause a user to be redirected to another URL of the attacker's choosing by manipulating a parameter.<br><br>For example, if the following example URL was sent to a user:<br><br><code>http://www.example.com/redirect.cgi?RedirectURL=www.PhishingWebsite.com<br></code><br><br>An attacker could obfuscate the RedirectURL parameter to make it less obvious to the user that they would be redirected to a phishing site. A URL like this could be sent to users in a phishing e-mail; since the URL contains the domain of a valid web site (www.example.com), users may be less likely to recognize it as part of a phishing attack. Were a user to click on the URL, they could be redirected to a phishing site that looks exactly like www.example.com, but is the attacker's web site. This could also be used to redirect users to web sites with malicious software embedded in the page, to exploit outdated or unpatched browsers.<br>"}}}
