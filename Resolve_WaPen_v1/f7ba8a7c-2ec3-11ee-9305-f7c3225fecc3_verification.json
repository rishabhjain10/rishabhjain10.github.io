Use Burp Intruder to mark specific injection points, and use Burp Scanner to test just those injection points. Alternatively use Burp Intruder fuzzing templates to test all meaningful parameters.\r<br>\r<br>In JSON requests, enclose all parameter values in double quotes prior to fuzzing; it is common that integer fields are not in quotes but the endpoint may accept strings as well.\r<br>\r<br>WCF may use msbin1 serialization for web services requests.
