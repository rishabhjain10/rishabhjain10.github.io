If the path exists in an error message, design and add consistent error handling mechanisms that can handle any user input to the web application, provide meaningful detail to end-users, and prevent error messages that might provide information useful to an attacker from being displayed.<br>","name":"Information Disclosure - Server Path","sourceId":"GID:2386","severity":"Low","businessImpact":"Fully qualified server path names allow an attacker to identify the file system structure of the web server, which can be used as a baseline when planning future attacks.","description":"A fully qualified path name was discovered. This most often occurs in context of an error produced by the web application or when path names are left within comments.<br>"}}}
